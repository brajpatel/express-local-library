# Express Local Library
This project was created by following along with and completing the several challenges in MDN Web Docs [Express Tutorial: The Local Library Website](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Tutorial_local_library_website). This proved to be a great opportunity to learn (and reinforce) how to create forms using pug, validate and sanitise input using 'express-validator' and add, delete and modify/update records in a database.
